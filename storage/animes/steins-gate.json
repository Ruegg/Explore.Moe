Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","started_airing_date":"2011-04-06","finished_airing_date":"2011-09-14","cover_image":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5646/tiny.jpg?1519181979","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5646/small.jpg?1519181979","medium":"","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/5646/large.jpg?1519181979"},"poster_image":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5646/tiny.jpg?1505188227","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5646/small.jpg?1505188227","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5646/medium.jpg?1505188227","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/5646/large.jpg?1505188227"},"genres":[],"age_rating":"PG","episode_count":24,"community_rating":4.167,"entries":[],"smartentries":[]}
